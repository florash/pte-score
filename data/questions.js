    // ★ High-frequency real exam questions
    { id:'ra1', tag:'★ 高频真题', text:"Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges facing humanity in the twenty-first century. Rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and increasingly frequent extreme weather events are all consequences of greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activity. Scientists around the world agree that immediate action is necessary to prevent catastrophic environmental damage." },
    { id:'ra2', tag:'★ 高频真题', text:"The development of artificial intelligence has transformed numerous industries, from healthcare to transportation. Machine learning algorithms can now diagnose diseases with remarkable accuracy, optimize supply chains, and even compose music. However, questions about ethics, privacy, and the future of employment remain central to public debate." },
    { id:'ra3', tag:'★ 高频真题', text:"Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power are playing an increasingly important role in the global energy mix. As the cost of solar panels continues to fall and battery storage technology improves, many countries are accelerating their transition away from fossil fuels toward cleaner alternatives." },
    { id:'ra4', tag:'真题', text:"The human brain remains one of the most complex structures in the known universe. Containing approximately eighty-six billion neurons, each connected to thousands of others, it processes sensory information, regulates bodily functions, and generates consciousness. Neuroscientists continue to unravel its mysteries using advanced imaging technologies." },
    { id:'ra5', tag:'真题', text:"Urbanization is one of the defining trends of the modern era. More than half of the world's population now lives in cities, a proportion expected to rise to two-thirds by two thousand and fifty. This rapid shift brings significant challenges related to housing, transportation, public health, and environmental sustainability." },
    { id:'ra6', tag:'★ 高频真题', text:"The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland in northeastern Australia, is the world's largest coral reef system. It stretches over two thousand three hundred kilometres and is home to an extraordinary diversity of marine life. However, rising ocean temperatures caused by climate change have led to repeated mass coral bleaching events, threatening its long-term survival." },
    { id:'ra7', tag:'★ 高频真题', text:"Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognise and combat specific pathogens. When a person receives a vaccine, their immune system responds by producing antibodies. These antibodies remain in the body, providing protection if the person is later exposed to the actual disease. Vaccination has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history." },
    { id:'ra8', tag:'预测题', text:"The global food system faces the dual challenge of feeding a growing population while reducing its environmental footprint. Agriculture accounts for roughly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, consumes seventy percent of the world's fresh water, and is the leading driver of biodiversity loss. Transforming food production systems is therefore essential to achieving sustainability goals." },
    { id:'ra9', tag:'预测题', text:"Space exploration has entered a new era defined by commercial enterprise and international collaboration. Private companies are now capable of launching satellites, supplying the International Space Station, and developing vehicles for human spaceflight. Meanwhile, space agencies around the world are collaborating on missions to the Moon and Mars, opening possibilities that once seemed purely the domain of science fiction." },
    { id:'ra10', tag:'★ 高频真题', text:"Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to global health, food security, and development. Bacteria that were once easily treated have evolved mechanisms to survive antibiotic treatment. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans and livestock has accelerated this process. Without effective antibiotics, even minor infections and routine surgical procedures could become life-threatening." },
    { id:'ra11', tag:'真题', text:"The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late eighteenth century, fundamentally altered the structure of economies and societies worldwide. Steam-powered machinery enabled the mass production of goods, railways transformed transportation, and factories drew millions of workers from rural areas into cities. The legacy of this transformation continues to shape the modern world." },
    { id:'ra12', tag:'预测题', text:"Meditation has been practised for thousands of years across many cultures and religious traditions. In recent decades, scientific research has begun to document its effects on the brain and body. Studies suggest that regular meditation can reduce stress and anxiety, improve concentration, lower blood pressure, and enhance overall wellbeing. It is increasingly recommended as a complementary approach in clinical settings." },
    { id:'ra13', tag:'★ 高频预测题', text:"Urban forests provide a wide range of environmental and social benefits to modern cities. Trees reduce air pollution, moderate extreme temperatures, absorb stormwater, and create habitats for birds and insects. Access to green spaces is also associated with improved mental health and stronger community wellbeing. As cities continue to expand, protecting and restoring urban tree cover has become an important planning priority." },
    { id:'ra14', tag:'预测题', text:"Digital literacy is now regarded as a fundamental skill for participation in modern society. Beyond simply using devices, it includes the ability to evaluate online information, protect personal privacy, communicate effectively in digital environments, and adapt to emerging technologies. Schools, universities, and employers increasingly recognise that digital literacy is essential for academic success, employability, and informed citizenship." },
    { id:'ra15', tag:'预测题', text:"Volcanic eruptions can influence both local environments and global climate systems. In addition to lava flows and ash clouds, major eruptions release gases and fine particles high into the atmosphere. These particles can reflect sunlight and temporarily reduce global temperatures. Studying past eruptions helps scientists understand natural climate variability and improve hazard preparedness for communities living near volcanoes." },
    { id:'ra16', tag:'新增题', text:"The rapid growth of urban populations has placed increasing pressure on public transportation systems and infrastructure." },

    { id:'rl1', tag:'★ 高频真题', title:"The Water Cycle", transcript:"Water is continuously cycled through the environment in a process driven by solar energy. Evaporation from oceans and lakes transforms liquid water into vapor, which rises into the atmosphere. As it cools, condensation forms clouds. Eventually, precipitation returns water to the surface as rain or snow. This cycle regulates global temperatures, distributes fresh water, and sustains all life on Earth.", duration: 45 },
    { id:'rl2', tag:'★ 高频真题', title:"The Industrial Revolution", transcript:"The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late eighteenth century, transformed the way goods were produced. Steam-powered machines replaced manual labour in factories, dramatically increasing output. New transportation networks, including railways and canals, enabled mass distribution. However, urbanization also led to poor living conditions for many factory workers, sparking early labour movements.", duration: 50 },
    { id:'rl3', tag:'真题', title:"Neuroplasticity", transcript:"Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's remarkable ability to reorganise itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This capacity allows the brain to compensate for injury or disease and to adjust in response to new situations or changes in the environment. Research has shown that activities such as learning a new language, playing a musical instrument, or regular physical exercise can promote neuroplasticity and help maintain cognitive function into old age.", duration: 55 },
    { id:'rl4', tag:'预测题', title:"Coral Reef Ecosystems", transcript:"Coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems on Earth, covering less than one percent of the ocean floor but supporting approximately twenty-five percent of all marine species. They provide vital services including coastal protection, food security, and income from tourism and fisheries for hundreds of millions of people. However, climate change, ocean acidification, and human activities such as overfishing and pollution are rapidly degrading reef systems worldwide.", duration: 58 },
    { id:'rl5', tag:'预测题', title:"Behavioural Economics", transcript:"Behavioural economics combines insights from psychology and economics to understand how people actually make decisions, as opposed to how traditional economic theory assumes they should. Research in this field has shown that people are subject to cognitive biases — systematic errors in thinking — that lead to choices that may not serve their best interests. These findings have influenced policy design, with governments using nudges to encourage healthier and more financially sound behaviour.", duration: 52 },
    { id:'rl6', tag:'★ 高频预测题', title:"Renewable Energy Storage", transcript:"Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are intermittent, meaning they do not produce electricity at all times. Energy storage technologies address this problem by capturing excess electricity when production is high and releasing it when demand rises. Batteries are the most widely discussed option, but pumped hydro, thermal storage, and hydrogen systems are also gaining attention. Improving storage capacity is essential if countries are to build reliable low-carbon power systems.", duration: 54 },
    { id:'rl7', tag:'预测题', title:"Language and Identity", transcript:"Language is more than a tool for communication; it is also a marker of identity, culture, and belonging. When minority languages disappear, communities lose not only vocabulary and grammar, but also stories, traditions, and unique ways of understanding the world. Linguists estimate that nearly half of the world's languages may disappear within this century unless active preservation efforts are made. Education policy, media representation, and community-led programs all play important roles in language maintenance.", duration: 57 },

The consequences extend beyond the natural world: healthy ecosystems provide clean water, regulate climate, pollinate crops, and support countless industries. Conservation efforts, including protected areas, habitat restoration, and international agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, aim to slow this decline, but experts agree that transformative changes in how we produce food and energy are essential.", wordRange:[25,50] },

Every online interaction generates data points that companies harvest, analyse, and monetise.

While users often receive free services in exchange, many are unaware of the extent to which their information is collected and sold.

    { id:'hcs1', title:"The Sharing Economy", transcript:"The sharing economy describes a system where individuals share access to goods and services, often facilitated by digital platforms. Companies like Airbnb and Uber have disrupted traditional industries by enabling peer-to-peer transactions. Supporters highlight the efficiency gains from better resource utilisation — an idle car or spare room can now generate income. Critics, however, point to concerns about worker rights, safety regulations, and the impact on local communities, particularly rising housing costs in cities where short-term rentals proliferate.",

    { id:'hcs2', title:"Online Education", transcript:"Universities have expanded their use of online education over the past decade, and this trend accelerated sharply during the pandemic. Online delivery offers flexibility and can widen access for students who live far from campus or who balance study with work. At the same time, educators warn that online learning may reduce spontaneous interaction, weaken a sense of community, and disadvantage students with poor internet access. As a result, many institutions are moving toward blended models that combine digital convenience with face-to-face engagement.",
      summaries:[
        "Online education increases flexibility and access, but many institutions now prefer blended models because fully online learning also has limitations.",
        "Universities have replaced all face-to-face teaching with online platforms because students strongly prefer digital classes.",
        "Online education is mainly useful because it removes the need for teachers and campus facilities altogether.",
